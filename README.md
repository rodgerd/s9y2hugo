# s9y2hugo

s9y2hugo is designed to aid in migrating from a Serendipity blog to a Hugo one.

It takes input as CSV, generated by an accompanying SQL script, and
writes a set of files in Hugo format.

It will carry over the title, frontmatter, and body of the entries,
and use Hugo's "alias" feature to carry over the permalinks as
aliases.

## Usage

Use the SQL script to generate CSV and pipe it through s9y2hugo.
